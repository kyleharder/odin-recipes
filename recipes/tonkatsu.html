    <ul>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> ketchup</li>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> soy sauce</li>
        <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> brown sugar</li>
        <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 tsp</strong> Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li><strong>1 clove</strong> minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Tonkatsu Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, and garlic in a bowl</li>
        <li>Let flavours blend for at least 30 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Pork Cutlets</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the pork loins:</strong> Cut slits into the white connective tissue on the outer edge of each pork loin or pork chop. This prevents it from curling up as it cooks. Flatten each pork loin to about ¾ inch thickness.</li>
        <li><strong>Dredge the pork loins: </strong>Add the egg, flour, and panko bread crumbs to separate bowls. For a crispier crust, mix a tablespoon of flour with the egg to create a thicker egg wash for more bread crumbs to adhere to.<br>
        Salt and pepper the pork, then coat it in flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the beaten egg and then firmly press it into the panko bread crumbs for a thick, generous layer of breading</li>
        <li><strong>Heat oil: </strong>In a large heavy-duty pot or fryer, add enough oil to deep fry the cutlets. Heat the oil to 340°F over medium heat to ensure the pork fully cooks without burning the bread crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the pork cutlets:</strong> Gently place a pork cutlet into the oil and deep-fry for 5 to 6 minutes per side or until the pork is fully cooked and the panko coating is golden brown and crispy.<br>
        Use a skimmer to clean up loose breadcrumbs and try to keep the oil temperature at 340°F. Repeat with the remaining cutlets and work in batches to avoid lowering the oil temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Slice the tonkatsu and serve with tonkatsu sauce, shredded cabbage, and rice. Enjoy!</li>
